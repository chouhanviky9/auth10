Requirements
● Design and implement appropriate RESTful APIs for user registration (first name, last
name, username, email, and password), authentication and user details using
Node.js with Express.js. The email and username must be unique.
● Implement server-side validation (Joi) to ensure that incoming data is properly
validated before processing.
● Implement secure password hashing and storage using a proven hashing algorithm,
such as bcrypt, to ensure the security of user passwords.
● Implement token-based authentication, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to
securely manage user sessions and authentication status.
● Use an ORM (e.g., Sequelize) to interact with your database from your Node.js
application
● Implement appropriate error handling to provide meaningful error responses to
frontend requests in case of invalid input, authentication failures, or other errors.
● Use best practices for secure coding, such as server-side input validation,
parameterized queries (to prevent SQL injection), and protection against cross-site
scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
● Document the steps on how to set up the development environment and deploy the
application for our testing and review.

plan :-)

- intialize and spin the server
- connect database
- define user schema
- define access token schema
- create user and token services
- use joi for validations
